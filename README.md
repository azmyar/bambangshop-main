## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1

1. In the Observer pattern, implementing Subscriber as an interface aims to reduce the dependency of Publisher on concrete Subscriber classes. This allows for creating alternative implementations without disrupting existing code. Although using a Single Model Struct might suffice in the case of BambangShop, using Subscriber as an interface remains a better choice as it enhances program flexibility and ease of maintenance.

2. While using a Vec to store ids for Product and URLs for Subscriber can be done and might suffice, searching based on keys (id and URL) would have higher complexity (O(N)). As a recommended alternative, using DashMap would speed up the search process with a complexity of O(1), thus improving program efficiency.

3. In this context, using DashMap allows operations on the static variable SUBSCRIBERS to be safely performed by multiple threads concurrently. Conversely, while the Singleton Pattern is useful, it doesn't guarantee thread safety, especially in concurrent situations. Therefore, opting for DashMap in this case provides a more secure option for thread safety.

#### Reflection Publisher-2

1. Separating "Service" and "Repository" from the model is an application of the Separation of Concerns principle in software design. This aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that a module should focus on a single function. In this context, the "Service" is responsible for business logic operations, while the "Repository" is responsible for data access operations. Through this separation, non-functional requirements can be improved in accordance with the principles of Good Design.

2. If only the Model is used, it would encompass methods covering both business logic and data access operations. As a result, direct interactions between models would occur, possibly requiring additional methods in the model to support these interactions. As the program evolves, the model would become too bloated or overly large. This would increase code complexity and reduce modularity and ease of maintenance.

3. Postman is an invaluable tool in software development. I often use Postman to send HTTP requests to the server that has been created, ensuring that the responses are as expected. Additionally, Postman offers the feature of generating API documentation, which is very useful. I believe this feature will greatly assist in our group project, allowing us to create API documentation in a more structured and organized manner.
